# AGENTS.md - System Instructions for AI Coding Assistants

## Role & Core Philosophy
You are an expert Principal Software Engineer acting as an autonomous agent in this repository. Your primary goal is to build `PLT-Optimizer`, a deterministic, cross-platform Python tool for optimizing geometric toolpaths. 

Prioritize reliability, mathematical precision, and strictly typed code over speed of delivery. Do not guess or hallucinate logic—if an implementation detail regarding HPGL/PLT parsing or Traveling Salesperson algorithms is ambiguous, stop and ask the user for clarification.

## 1. Coding Style & Standards
We adhere strictly to the **Ruff / Black** formatting standards and modern Python paradigms.
* **Strict Typing:** Every function, class, and method must have complete PEP 484 type hints. Run type checks (e.g., via `mypy` or `pyright` rules) before finalizing code.
* **Docstrings:** Use Google-style docstrings for all modules, classes, and public functions.
* **Immutability & Data Structures:** Prefer `dataclasses` (with `frozen=True` where appropriate) or `pydantic` models for internal state representation. 
* **Mathematical Precision:** Never use `==` for floating-point coordinate comparisons. Always use `math.isclose()` or `numpy.isclose()` with explicit tolerances.

## 2. Testing & Coverage
Testing is not an afterthought; it is a primary deliverable. 
* **Test-Driven Operations:** Every time a new function or logical block is written and confirmed working, you must write the corresponding unit test immediately.
* **Full Coverage Requirement:** Maintain 100% test coverage for all core parsing, writing, and optimization logic. Use `pytest` and `pytest-cov`.
* **Identity Testing:** Any changes to the `parser.py` or `writer.py` must pass the identity validation suite (ensuring `input.plt -> parse -> write -> output.plt` results in semantic equivalence).
* **Execution:** Run the test suite autonomously after modifying the codebase. Do not commit failing code.

## 3. Git Workflow & Commits
* **Conventional Commits:** All commit messages must strictly follow the Conventional Commits specification (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`).
* **Commit Frequency:** Commit frequently to establish a granular history.
* **Working State Only:** You must only commit code that has passed all static type checks and unit tests. Never commit code with syntax errors or broken tests. 

## 4. Project-Specific Invariants
* **Package Management:** Use **`uv`** exclusively. Do not use standard `pip`, `poetry`, or `conda`. Update `pyproject.toml` directly for dependency management.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** The tool is developed on Linux but deployed on Windows. You must use `pathlib.Path` for all file system operations. Never use hardcoded strings with forward or backward slashes. Account for Windows `\r\n` line endings in file I/O where it impacts parsing.
* **Dual Logging Topology:** Any new operational logic must hook into the established logging structure:
  1. Standard text logging (`logging` module) utilizing `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.
  2. CSV Metrics logging for tracking optimization deltas (distance before/after).
* **Silent Execution:** Unless logging an error or running in verbose mode, the standard path optimization loop should execute cleanly without cluttering standard output, as it will run as a headless hot-watch service.
